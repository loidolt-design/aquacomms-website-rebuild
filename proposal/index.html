      <h2>What's So Great About Gatsby?</h2>
      <p>
        Gatsby is a state-of-the-art website builder that combines speed,
        security, and stunning design. With Gatsby, your website will load
        instantly, impress visitors with its modern look, and keep you ahead of
        the competition in the online world.

          <b class="list-header">Lightning-Fast Performance:</b>
          <p>
            With a rebuilt Gatsby site powered by WordPress as a headless CMS,
            your website will load in the blink of an eye. Say goodbye to
            sluggish page speeds and hello to an exceptional user experience

          <b class="list-header">Enhanced Security:</b>
          <p>
            Your website's security is paramount. By leveraging Gatsby's static
            site generation and decoupling the frontend from WordPress,
            potential vulnerabilities associated with plugins or server-side
            code execution are minimized. Enjoy peace of mind knowing that your
            site and valuable data are protected.

          <p>
            As your business grows, your website needs to keep up. Gatsby's
            scalability ensures your site can handle surges in traffic without
            compromising performance. Whether it's a sudden influx of visitors
            or future expansion plans, your Gatsby site will deliver a seamless
            experience to every user.

            Embrace the power of modern web development with Gatsby. Its
            cutting-edge technologies, like React and GraphQL, future-proof your
            site, making it adaptable to emerging trends and advancements. Stay

            synchronized and hassle-free workflow.

        <h2>Utilize Aqua Comms' Existing WordPress CMS</h2>
        <p>
          Aqua Comms can leverage the investment in its existing WordPress
          installation by transforming it into a powerful headless CMS. Gatsby
          can fetch content from WordPress via the inbuilt REST API or an
          offically supported GraphQL API, allowing Aqua Comms to manage and
          update website content seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a popular solution that retains the ease of use that WordPress
          provides to media and content management teams while providing the
          performance, flexiblity, and scalability of a static site generator.

        <h2>Why Rebuilding The Current Website is Necessary</h2>
        <p>
          It's important to understand why Aqua Comms' current website may be
          outdated and why a rebuild is necessary to ensure the company stays
          ahead in the telecommunications industry. Here are a few key reasons:

            <i class="material-icons">face</i>
            <b class="list-header">Enhanced User Experience:</b>
            <p>
              Outdated websites lead to a poor user experience, reducing
              engagement and sales. By updating the design, we create a seamless
              and user-friendly experience that increases customer satisfaction
              and conversions.

            <b class="list-header">Reflecting Brand Identity:</b>
            <p>
              Websites represent a company's brand. Outdated design elements and
              inconsistencies erode credibility and trust. Redesigning ensures a
              consistent and modern brand image that attracts customers and
              establishes a strong presence.

            <b class="list-header">Mobile Responsiveness:</b>
            <p>
              With mobile devices being prevalent, a mobile-responsive website
              is crucial. Outdated designs alienate a significant portion of the
              audience. Revamping the design with mobile-first approach provides
              a captivating experience across all devices, maximizing engagement
              and conversions.

            <p>
              Outdated designs hinder search engine rankings, reducing organic
              traffic and growth opportunities. Modern designs that are
              optimized for search engines improve visibility, attract more
              organic traffic, and drive business growth.

            <p>
              Outdated websites discourage top talent from applying.
              Revitalizing the design creates an engaging and user-friendly
              experience that showcases the company's culture, values, and
              career opportunities, attracting and retaining the best
              candidates.

          By rebuilding Aqua Comms' website with Gatsby, the company can address
          these issues and leverage modern technologies to deliver a visually
          stunning, highly functional, and secure website that positions Aqua
          Comms as a leading player in the telecommunications industry.

          Alternatively, I can offer an hourly basis for this project. Many

          flexibility in adding new features and requests without requiring a
          full revised estimate in case of scope changes. In this scenario, I
          would provide a weekly commitment of hours for your rebuild and bill
